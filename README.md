chrome-discover-balance
=======================

Chrome Extension. DiscoverCard balance is usually just pending + posted transactions (or CreditLimit - CreditAvailable). I got tired of doing the math every time I want to know my actual balance.

## TODO

- add icons in folder `icons/`
- take pending payments into account
